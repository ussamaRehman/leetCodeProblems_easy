Problem:
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum,
return True if there exists a root-to-leaf path such that
the sum of the node values equals targetSum.

Approach:
- Use recursive DFS.
- At each node, subtract its value from the targetSum.
- If a leaf is reached and the remaining target is 0 â†’ return True.
- Recurse into left and right subtrees otherwise.

Complexity:
- Time: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
- Space: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (recursion depth).
